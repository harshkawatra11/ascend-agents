"""SmartHealthAgent-style Gemini tool-calling orchestration.

Agent loop: user message -> Gemini decides which tool(s) to call -> tools
execute against services/ -> results fed back -> final natural-language answer.
Max 5 iterations with a graceful fallback if the API key/quota is unavailable
or the loop stalls.

Gemini is used for EXPLANATION only, never prediction (docs/05-ai-engine.md) —
every tool call reads already-computed forecasts/recommendations; the model
just narrates them.

Uses the `google-genai` SDK (the successor to the deprecated
`google-generativeai` package, which mishandles newer non-`AIza`-prefixed
API key formats and mistakenly sends them as OAuth bearer tokens).
