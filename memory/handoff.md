# Handoff

If you're picking this up fresh, read in this order:
1. `docs/00-vision.md` — what we're building and why
2. `memory/decision-log.md` — locked decisions, don't relitigate these
3. `memory/next-tasks.md` — what's queued
4. `docs/01-architecture.md` through `docs/07-recommendation-engine.md` — technical contracts before touching code
5. `docs/08-design-system.md` — non-negotiable: no blue-purple, editorial beige palette

## Key constraints to respect
- AI never auto-executes; recommendations always start `pending` (see `docs/07-recommendation-engine.md`).
- Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) explains, never predicts numbers.
- No spending beyond GCP credits + Gemini free/AI-Studio tier — flag anything else before proceeding.
- GitHub: main app `harshkawatra11/SwasthyaGrid-gdg-buildwithai`, CI/CD green. CRM: `harshkawatra11/SwasthyaGrid-CRM`, separate repo, no CI configured.
- Live sites: **https://swasthyagrid.vercel.app** (Vercel project `swasthyagrid`, team `gursimrannkaurr04` — a teammate's account, not `harsh-s-vercel-team` as earlier notes said; it moved at some point) and **https://swasthyagrid-crm.vercel.app** (Vercel project `swasthyagrid-crm`, same team). Neither has GitHub auto-deploy connected for the CRM (cross-account permissions); redeploy both via `vercel deploy --prod` from their respective folders.
- Never extract or use stored CLI/tool auth tokens, service account keys, or session cookies directly to bypass a missing CLI/MCP feature or to debug — use hashes/lengths/status codes instead of printing secret values, and find a config-file-based workaround (e.g. the root `vercel.json` for the monorepo Root Directory issue) or ask the user to do the one dashboard click.
- Service account keys live only in `ai-healthcare-crm/.secrets-tmp/` (gitignored) — never move them, never print their contents.

## State as of end of Session 5 (current)
Two live, linked apps:
- **SwasthyaGrid AI** — frontend on Vercel, backend on Cloud Run, now reading **live Firestore** (20s TTL, JSON-seed fallback preserved) instead of only the static seed.
- **SwasthyaGrid Intake** (`ai-healthcare-crm/`) — a separate CRM app/repo/Vercel deploy where PHC/CHC staff log in and edit their facility's data, writing to the *same* Firestore project (`swasthyagrid-ai-54886`). Verified in production: an edit in the CRM shows up in SwasthyaGrid AI's API within the TTL window with a correctly recomputed risk level.

Demo login credentials (Firestore `crm_users`, not committed anywhere): `phc-rural-14`, `phc-sector-12`, `chc-east` (facility role), `district-admin` (admin role) — shared password `Swasthya@2026`, printed by `node ai-healthcare-crm/scripts/seed-users.mjs`.

## What's still pending
See `memory/next-tasks.md` for the full backlog — nothing blocking for the demo. Two rough edges: the CRM's Vercel deploy isn't git-connected (manual `vercel deploy --prod` needed for future changes), and the CRM's doctor attendance toggle doesn't yet feed the backend's attendance-risk computation (that stays static from the seed).

## GCP project reference
Project `swasthyagrid-ai-54886`, region `asia-south1`, billing account `010FBB-4DDDDA-4656C5`. Firestore is now load-bearing for **both** apps — tearing down the project (`gcloud projects delete swasthyagrid-ai-54886`) takes down the CRM's data too, not just the backend.
